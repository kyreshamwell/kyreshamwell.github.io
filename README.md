# Kyre's Portfolio

This repository contains my first portfolio, created to showcase the coding projects 
I completed throughout my college years before starting my senior projects. 
Here you'll find examples of my work in programming, web development, and coursework 
from North Carolina A&T State University.

As I continue to grow and gain new skills in my full-time position, I plan to build 
a future portfolio that highlights new projects and experiences. This portfolio stands 
as a snapshot of my development up to this point and marks the beginning of my professional journey.
