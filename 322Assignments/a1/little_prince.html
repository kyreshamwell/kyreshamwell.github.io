    <p>As the litle prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u> 
        <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled 
        in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="lettercollor"><strong>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</strong></span> As his lips opened slightly with 
        the suspicion of a half-smole, I said to myself, again: <span class="lettercollor"><strong>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the
         image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . . " </strong></span>And I felt him to be more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of protecting him, 
            as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind. . .</u></p>
