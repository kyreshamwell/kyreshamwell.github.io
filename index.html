        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout my four years at North Carolina A&T State University, I have gained numerous skills that I can carry into my career. I had the chance to learn proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL. Additionally, I completed courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning, earning a certification in generative AI. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While at A&T, I became an active member of ACM and NSBE, where I had the opportunity to network with peers and professionals, participate in hackathons, and engage in various events and activities. I am also honored to be a TMCF (Thurgood Marshall College Fund) Scholar and an ELC (Executive Leadership Council) Scholar, collectively receiving over $20,000 in scholarship funds.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional experiences have been equally rewarding. I received two offers from Collins Aerospace. The first was a fully remote co-op position on the Digital Technology Cloud and Automation team in 2023. In this role, I migrated file shares to a new data security platform and assisted end users with data security solutions. This experience helped me strengthen skills in teamwork, time management, and problem-solving, as I collaborated with team members to address IT challenges while balancing full-time studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the co-op, I secured a software engineering internship at Collins Aerospace. My primary responsibility was migrating legacy Python 2 code to Python 3, which included modifying tests and creating an HTML-based test output system that allowed tests to run independently of a GUI. I converted GUI-based tests to Python 3 for command-line execution, logging results to text files. Additionally, I designed an HTML interface using a Python localhost server and JavaScript to display formatted test outputs. I tested the updated Python 3 scripts on Airborne Flight Display (AFD) and FOMAX devices, ensuring their functionality and reliability. Finally, I committed Python 3 modifications to GitLab using a Linux server and documented the process in AsciiDoc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my time at A&T, I maintained a GPA above 3.0 and achieved Dean’s List honors once during each academic year (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years). These accomplishments, coupled with the invaluable experiences and skills I’ve gained, have shaped me into a capable and motivated professional ready to contribute meaningfully in my future career.
